# hackintosh-info


Let's create a script to display information about our device, similar to the one used by the "About This Hack" app and "neofetch." To create this script, we used ChatGPT and asked it not to create the script following the requested data.

The process was very interesting, and we added the data detailed below. The most complicated part was adding our device's audio, as it's difficult to determine the chip because it doesn't appear as such on a Mac.

To create and modify it we used XCODE

--System Versi√≥n--

This first script can be added parameters that allow us to have detailed information about our team, even giving it color.

Add this script as a base to be downloaded, you can modify it to your liking, it is free to be used but leave the Credits, which is what allows Hackintosh to remain alive.
